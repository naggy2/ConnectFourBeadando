# ConnectFour

This repository made for a university project, used C++11 and a graphic library made by our lecturer. (Hungarian) Documentation of the used graphic library: http://users.itk.ppke.hu/~flugi/grafikuslib/graphics.html

Most important part of the project was to implement a set of widgets which we had to code and design throught the semester.

The application is a simple connect four game.
The graphic elements was written in the widgets' classes. The rules, regulation and the computing was implemented in the Gamemaster class. And the application class runs and handles the game.
